Both equations are fundamental equations in fluid mechanics, yet mathematically, many standard questions in the theory of partial differential equations such as existence, uniqueness, and regularity are still open. Let me first explain what these properties mean and then point out a small selection of the currently open issues related to these.\nExistence: For any initial state of the fluid and other fixed parameters such as boundary data, we would like there to exist a solution to these fluid equations which describes the fluid at any later time. After all, we describe a physical problem and would expect solutions to exist.\nExistence of (weak) solutions for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations has been known since the work of Leray in 1934. For the 2D Euler equations, many general existence results for weak solutions have been obtained in the past 15 years using the convex integration machinery by Camillo De Lellis and L√°szl√≥ Sz√©kelyhidi Jr. Uniqueness: Ideally, the solutions to these equations should also be unique. After all, if all the data is fixed, our intuition would expect that the behavior of the fluid is deterministic, rather than having to deal with the possibility of the fluid behaving (at random) in different ways.\nJust in the past year, however, Albritton, Bru√© and Colombo proved that for a certain external force $f$, the Leray-solutions are in fact non-unique. Moreover, the convex integration solutions for the 2D Euler equations are vastly non-unique, in fact, this technique yields infinitely many solutions for any given initial state. To resolve this issue, it is an ongoing task to find further conditions, which single out physical solutions. Regularity means that in a certain way, if the data has nice properties, which correspond to real physical fluids, then the solutions at least maintain that regularity.\nIn constrast to the previously mentioned weak solution, regular solutions are unique. However, it is generally unknown if regular initial data yields regular solutions globally in time for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. If this was false, it would mean that a nice initial state of the fluid could in time develop singularities, meaning that the fluid has infinite velocity at certain points in space in time. While physically, this is impossible, precise mathematical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations has still not ruled this out. This is in fact one the Millenium prize problems by the Clay Mathematics Institute, deemed to be one of the most important open mathematical problems, with a $1 Million prize. The problem is likewise open for the 3D Euler equations. The Euler equations or Navier-Stokes equations with very small viscosity $\\nu \u0026gt; 0$ (or high Reynolds number) are generally associated to turbulent fluid flows. One aspect of turbulent fluids is their unpredictable behavior, note that this directly implies that unique deterministic solutions should not be expected. However, experimentally, it is widely accepted that certain statistical properties of turbulent fluids are in fact reproducible, whereby a probabilistic or statistical solution concept may be most natural. One approach would be to assume that the system is in fact described by a deterministic component plus some noise, which leads to a model based on stochastic differential equations.\nSomewhat differently, rather than trying to describe single, individual solutions, another approach is to describe a whole ensemble of solutions or possible states of the system by a probability distribution on an appropriate phase space. Then, one studies the evolution in time of these distributions. This latter approach can somewhat loosely be found in work by Hopf in 1950 and in a precise framework from 1972 and 1973 by Foias and in 1978 by Vishik and Fursikov for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.\nBased on further study of these statistical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, the main subject of my doctoral studies involved the development of analogous notions of statistical solutions for the 2D Euler equations.\nWagner, R.,Wiedemann, E.: Statistical solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in spaces of unbounded vorticity.
