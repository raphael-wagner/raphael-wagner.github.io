I am doctoral student at the Institute of Applied Analysis at Ulm University, expected to graduate in early 2024. My research in the group of Prof. Dr. Emil Wiedemann focuses on statistical concepts in mathematical fluid dynamics, motivated by statistical descriptions of turbulence. Outside of my academic research, I am intrigued by recent trends in machine learning.

### News:
 - I submitted my doctoral thesis on 10th of October 2023. The defense is likely going to be in January 2024.
